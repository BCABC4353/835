1.10.2.1 Balancing
The amounts reported in the 835, if present, MUST balance at three different levels -- the service line, the claim, and the transaction. Adjustments within the 835, through use of the Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segments, CAS, or Provider Level Adjustment Segments, PLB, DECREASE the payment when the adjustment amount is POSITIVE, and INCREASE the payment when the adjustment amount is NEGATIVE. See Section 1.10.2.4 - Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segment Theory, for more details.

NOTE

Amounts are not present and balancing does not apply when an 835 is used ONLY to initiate an electronic funds transfer as described in Section 1.10.1.3 - Electronic Funds Transfer with the CCD+ ACH format. In this case, Table 2 and the PLB segment in Table 3 are not present.

1.10.2.1.1 Service Line Balancing
Figure 1.9 - Service Line Balancing Segments

Service Line Balancing Segments
Although the service payment information is optional, it is REQUIRED for all professional claims or anytime payment adjustments are related to specific line items from the original submitted claim. When used, the submitted service charge plus or minus the sum of all monetary adjustments must equal the amount paid for this service line.

Amount 1 - Amount 2 = Amount 3

where:

Amount 1 -- transmitted in the Service Payment Information Segment, SVC02 -- is the submitted charge for this service line.

Amount 2 -- transmitted in the Service Adjustment Segment, the sum of CAS03, 06, 09, 12, 15, and 18 -- is the monetary adjustment amount applied to this service line.

Amount 3 -- transmitted in the Service Payment Information Segment, SVC03 -- is the paid amount for this service line.

NOTES

Adjustments within CAS DECREASE the payment when the adjustment amount is POSITIVE, and INCREASE the payment when the adjustment amount is NEGATIVE.

Providing service detail is critical for business, especially when professional or fee-based services are involved.

All services for the claim being paid from the adjudication system must be reported. This may be a subset of the original claim services when claims are split. See Section 1.10.2.11 - Claim Splitting, for the requirements when splitting claims.

If any service detail is reported in the claim payment, all services for the claim payment must be reported.

See Section 1.10.2.19 - Reporting Encounters in the 835 for additional information and for the service line reporting exception for encounter services.

1.10.2.1.2 Claim Balancing
Figure 1.10 - Claim Balancing Segments

Claim Balancing Segments
Balancing must occur within each Claim Payment loop so that the submitted charges for the claim minus the sum of all monetary adjustments equals the claim paid amount.

When the Service Payment Information loop is not present, the following formula applies:

Amount 4 - Amount 5 = Amount 6

where,

Amount 4 -- transmitted in the Claim Payment Segment, CLP03 -- is the total submitted charge for the claim.

Amount 5 -- transmitted in the Claim Adjustment Segment, the sum of CAS03, 06, 09, 12, 15, and 18 -- is the monetary adjustment amount applied to this claim.

Amount 6 -- transmitted in the Claim Payment Segment, CLP04 -- is the paid amount for this claim.

When the Service Payment Information loop is present, the following formula applies:

Amount 7 - Amount 8 = Amount 9

where,

Amount 7 -- transmitted in the Claim Payment Segment, CLP03 -- is the total submitted charge for the claim.

Amount 8 -- transmitted in the Claim Adjustment Segment and/or Service Adjustment Segment, the sum of CAS03, 06, 09, 12, 15, and 18 -- is the monetary adjustment amount applied to this claim.

Amount 9 -- transmitted in the Claim Payment Segment, CLP04 -- is the paid amount for this claim.

NOTES

Adjustments within the Claim Adjustment or Service Adjustment Segments DECREASE the payment when the adjustment amount is POSITIVE and INCREASE the payment when the adjustment amount is NEGATIVE.

When balancing claims that include the Service Payment Information loop, all Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment monetary amounts are included in the balancing equation (amount 8 above). When balancing claims that do not include the Service payment Information loop, all Claim Adjustment monetary amounts are included in the balancing equation (Amount 5 above).

When the Service Payment Information loop is present, adjustments are reported in either the Claim Adjustment or the Service Adjustment Segments but not in both. For example, if a $100 deductible adjustment is taken at the service level, do not repeat that deductible at the claim level. It is preferred that the adjustment be shown at the service level when possible.

When specific service detail is presented, the claim level balancing includes balancing the total claim charge (CLP03) to the sum of the related service charges (SVC02). Service lines that are not finalized must be adjusted with a CAS segment using a Claim Adjustment Group code (CAS01) of 'OA' (Other Adjustment), a Claim Adjustment Reason code (CAS02) of 133 (This service is suspended pending further review) and the full dollar amount for the service in CAS03. When finalized, the claim must be reported using the instructions found in the Reversal and Correction section. See Section 1.10.2.11 - Claim Splitting, for variations related to claim splitting situations.

1.10.2.1.3 Transaction Balancing
Figure 1.11 - Transaction Balancing Segments

Transaction Balancing Segments
Within the transaction, the sum of all claim payments minus the sum of all provider level adjustments equals the total payment amount.

Amount 10 - Amount 11 = Amount 12

where:

Amount 10 -- the sum of all CLP04 amounts transmitted in the Claim Payment Segment -- is the total of all claim amounts included in this transaction set.

Amount 11 -- the sum of PLB04, 06, 08, 10, 12, and 14 transmitted in the Provider Adjustments Segment -- is the provider level adjustment made to the claim payment.

Amount 12 -- transmitted in the Financial Information Segment, BPR02 -- is the total payment amount of this claim payment.

NOTE

A POSITIVE amount in PLB indicates a DECREASE in the payment amount. A NEGATIVE amount in PLB indicates an INCREASE in the payment amount.

1.10.2.2 Remittance Tracking
Figure 1.12 - Remittance Tracking Segments

Remittance Tracking Segments
The Reassociation Key Segment, TRN, contains a trace number for the transaction set. Trace Number, TRN02, which is used to reassociate payments and remittances sent separately, must be a unique number for this business purpose between the payer and the payee. This will be:

For check payments, TRN02 is the check number.

For EFT payments, TRN02 is the unique number assigned by the payer to identify this EFT.

For non-payment transactions, TRN02 is a unique number generated by the transaction set originator as that 835's identification number (e.g., a control number plus a suffix or a date/time stamp).

In addition, TRN03 is the payer's identification number. TRN03 allows the payee to avoid matching problems in case multiple payers use the same number in TRN02.

NOTE

Due to the need for remittance tracking, there is a one to one relationship between any specific 835 and the related payment mechanism (check or EFT). One 835 must only relate to a single payment mechanism and one payment mechanism must only relate to a single 835. The only exception is a non-payment 835 (BPR02=0) where there is no associated payment mechanism.

1.10.2.4 Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segment Theory
The Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segments provide the reasons, amounts, and quantities of any adjustments that the payer made either to the original submitted charge or to the units related to the claim or service(s). The summation of the adjustments at the claim and service levels is the total adjustment for the entire claim. Service level adjustments are not repeated at the claim level.

Figure 1.13 - Claim and Service Adjustment Segments

Claim and Service Adjustment Segments
A standardized list of claim adjustment reason codes is used in the Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segments. See Appendix A, External Code Sources, for the List location. These codes provide the "explanation" for the positive or negative financial adjustments specific to particular claims or services that are referenced in the transmitted 835. Other financial adjustments can be expressed in the PLB segment; however, the claim adjustment reason code list is not used for provider level adjustments.

To facilitate and expedite reason code maintenance, the list was established external to the ASC X12 standards. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association created a committee of payer and provider representatives to maintain the list. As with any external code list, maintenance requests should be addressed to the responsible entity. Send maintenance requests in writing to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association or submit online via www.wpc-edi.com (preferred).

The Claim Adjustment Group Code, CAS01, categorizes the adjustment reason codes that are contained in a particular CAS. The Claim Adjustment Group Codes are evaluated according to the following order:

Is the amount adjusted in this segment the patient's responsibility?

Use code PR - Patient Responsibility.

Is the amount adjusted not the patient's responsibility under any circumstances due to either a contractual obligation between the provider and the payer or a regulatory requirement?

Use code CO - Contractual Obligation.

An example of a contractual obligation might be a Participating Provider Agreement.

In the payer's opinion, is the amount in this segment not the responsibility of the patient, without a supporting contract between the provider and the payer?

Use code PI - Payer Initiated.

If no other category is appropriate, do the following:

Use code OA - Other Adjustment.

Avoid using the Other Adjustment Group Code (OA) except for business situations described in sections 1.10.2.6, 1.10.2.7 and 1.10.2.13.

Only use the Claim Adjustment Segment if needed.

At either position -- the claim level or the service level -- each CAS can report up to six different adjustments related to a particular Claim Adjustment Group. This can be seen by noting the re-occurrence of the Claim Adjustment Reason, Monetary Amount, and Quantity data elements, referred to as "an adjustment trio," in the CAS. There is no direct correlation between any particular kind of adjustment and a specific adjustment data element trio. For example, a co-insurance adjustment does not belong at any specific position in the segment. The assumption is that no adjustment trio is used if no meaningful data is included. For efficiency, the first significant adjustment is placed at the first trio -- CAS02, 03, and 04. The six iterations (trios) of the Adjustment Reason Code related to the Specific Adjustment Group Code must be exhausted before repeating a second iteration of the CAS segment using the same Adjustment Group Code.

For example:

CAS*CO*5*793**131*25**96*1**110*3**115*5**15*42~

CAS*CO*119*250~

(Note: this example is only for the purpose of demonstrating the correct usage of CAS Group Codes and Adjustment Reason Codes in completing the 6 trios per CAS segment. The relationship of the Group Code and Adjustment Reason Codes as provided in the example are not intended to suggest what relationship may exist for your business

Adjustments do not get reported in an 835 in any specific order. The order for determining the applicable group is not intended to require reporting the groups in that order.

1.10.2.5 Advance Payments and Reconciliation
In some instances, the relationship between the payer and the provider involves periodic advance payments against expected claim volume and subsequent adjustments against the advance as the actual claims are processed. These advance payments can cover all claims, certain types of claims or a percentage of certain claims.

The advance payments and adjustments are made using an Adjustment Identifier composite and Monetary Amount element pair in the PLB segment (PLB 03/04, 05/06, 07/08, 09/10, 11/12 or 13/14).

The Adjustment Identifier consists of an Adjustment Reason Code and a Reference Identification element. For advance payments and subsequent adjustments (money taken back) the Adjustment Reason Code will be PI (Periodic Interim Payment). The Reference Identification must be used to identify the Payer assigned financial control number for the payment. This same control number must be supplied on all adjustments related to a payment to facilitate reconciliation by the provider.

The Monetary Amount element identifies the dollars involved and whether it is a payment or adjustment. A negative dollar amount indicates a payment, and increases the payment to the provider in the 835. A positive dollar amount indicates an adjustment and a reduction in the payment in the 835.

The 835 does not provide any association between any specific claim and the advance payment process in the PLB. The provider and payer should clearly establish the business details (claim/service types applicable) external to the 835.

NOTE

The advance payment adjustment is not specific to a particular claim and is not reducing the amount paid on the claim. It is an administrative adjustment related to the original advance payment. As a result, it is reported in the PLB segment and not in the CAS segment.

Example:

Medicaid State General Fund (SGF) and Federal Financial Participation (FFP) will be the multiple sources of funding and payment of certain claims.

If an applicable Medicaid claim is submitted for $100 it is paid out of two funds with $50 SGF and $50 FFP. The SGF portion may be paid on a 1/12 allotment of the year's estimate. e.g. If the provider will send in approximately $240,000 of claims, then $120,000 will be paid in $10,000 increments each month.

The monthly 1/12th payments get reported and paid in the 835 as a PLB adjustment, using the adjustment reason code of PI with a reference number for the period:

PLB*12345*20031231*PI:SGF87654*-10000~

When a claim is submitted, the claim paid amount (CLP04) will be $100. The FFP amount is paid by Medicaid and is part of the BPR02 payment amount for the 835. The SGF portion of the payment is credited against the estimated yearly amount that is being paid monthly and is recouped in the PLB segment. The total process will be reconciled at the end of the year in a cost report activity. Only the CLP and PLB segments are shown for simplicity.

CLP*A231623*1*100*100**MC*9878768~

PLB*12345*20031231*PI:SGF87654*50~

If there were 10 claims instead of 1 in the advance payment process for this remittance, the PLB would read:

PLB*12345*20031231*PI:SGF87654*500~

NOTE

Once the advanced payment has been completely recouped, the PLB adjustments cease until after the next advance payment. The payer and provider can establish the periodicity of the advance payment reconciliation process. For instance, with the example scenario above:

Use unique monthly advance payment reference identifications. Once you reach $10,000 in $50 adjustments for a given month, stop taking additional adjustments and start paying the full $100 for each additional claim that month -- or

Use one reference number for all of the payments in the year and always take the $50 adjustment on each claim. Reconcile at the end of the entire year (or start paying $100 once the yearly allotment has been exceeded).

1.10.2.6 Procedure Code Bundling and Unbundling
Procedure code bundling or unbundling occurs when a payer believes that the actual services performed and reported for a claim payment can be represented by a different group of procedure codes. Grouping usually results in a lower payment from the payer. Bundling occurs when two or more reported procedures are going to be paid under only one procedure code. Unbundling occurs when one submitted procedure code is to be paid and reported back as two or more different procedure codes. This results in an increase in the units of service for the claim.

Splitting of a service line with multiple units of service into multiple service lines and maintaining the same total units of service is not unbundling. See Section 1.10.2.14.1 - Service Line Splitting, for additional information.

When bundling or unbundling occurs, the information must be reported back to the payee accurately to facilitate automatic entry into a patient accounting/accounts receivable system. In the interest of standardization, payers are to report bundling or unbundling in a consistent manner.

When bundling, report all of the originally submitted procedures in the remittance advice. Report all procedures as paying on the changed (bundled) procedure code, and reference the original submitted code in SVC06. The bundled service line must be adjusted up by an amount equal to the sum of the other line charges. This is reported as a CAS segment with a group code OA (Other Adjustments) and a reason code of 94 (Processed in Excess of Charges) with a negative dollar amount. From that point, apply all normal CAS adjustments to derive the reimbursement amount. Report the other procedure or procedures as originally submitted, with an adjudicated code of the bundled procedure code and a Claim Adjustment Reason Code of 97 (payment is included in the allowance for the basic service) and an adjustment amount equal to the submitted charge. The Adjustment Group is either CO (Contractual Obligation) or PI (Payer Initiated) depending on the provider/payer relationship.

NOTE

The following examples illustrate bundling and unbundling within a PPO environment. Some segment use may vary from payer type to payer type.

Bundling Example

This is an example of a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) claim. This example leaves out the date and other segments not necessary to bundling.

The provider submits procedure code "A" and "B" for $100.00 each to his or her PPO as primary coverage. The procedures were performed on the same date of service.

The PPO's adjudication system screens the submitted procedures and notes that procedure "C" covers the services rendered by the provider on that single date of service.

The PPO's maximum allowed amount for procedure "C" is $120.00.

The patient's co-insurance amount for procedure "C" is $20.00.

The patient has not met the $50.00 deductible.

CLP*123456789*1*200*50*70*12~

CAS*PR*1*50~

SVC*HC:C*100*100***HC:A~

CAS*OA*94*-100~

CAS*CO*45*80~

CAS*PR*2*20~

SVC*HC:C*100*0**0*HC:B*1~

CAS*CO*97*100~

When unbundling, report the original service as the first of the new services with the original submitted charge in SVC02. Use subsequent SVC loops for the other new services. For these other services, report the submitted charge as zero dollars ($0.00). As in bundling, CAS is used to increase the submitted charge from $0.00 to the allowed amount for each procedure. Report the original procedure code in all of the SVC loops in SVC06. Balancing must be maintained for all service lines.

Unbundling Example

The same PPO provider submits a claim for one service.

The service code is "A" with a claim submitted charge and service charge of $200.00.

The payer unbundles this into 2 services -- "B" and "C" -- each with an allowed amount of $60.00.

There is no deductible or co-insurance amount.

Only segments specific to unbundling are included in the example. Adjustment reason code 45, "charges exceed your contracted/legislated fee arrangement," is used for each service.

CLP*123456789*1*200*120*0*12~

SVC*HC:B*200*60***HC:A~

CAS*CO*45*140~

SVC*HC:C*0*60***HC:A~

CAS*OA*94*-60~

Partial Unbundling

Partial unbundling may occur when a bundled panel of services, such as a lab panel or a surgical panel, is billed under a single HCPCS assigned to that panel, and a denial or reduction is made related to only one or some of the services in that panel. For example, two lab panels may include the same lab test. The full amount would be payable for the first panel, but a lesser amount may be due for the second panel due to the overlap.

Rather than totally unbundle the panels to be able to report detail on individual services within the panel, it is possible to do a partial unbundling to highlight only the individual service being adjusted. If this is done, however, you must report the regular allowed and payable amounts for the panel, then use a negative payment with the single adjusted service to offset for that reduction and to link that individual service to the HCPCS for the affected panel. The allowed amount for the single unbundled adjusted service in the panel must be reported as 0 when there is partial unbundling. This results in an increase in the units of service for the claim.

Splitting of a service line with multiple units of service into multiple service lines and maintaining the same total units of service is not unbundling. See Section 1.10.2.14.1 - Service Line Splitting, for additional information.

Partial Unbundling Example (Two lab panels billed and one test repeated in each):

CLP*123456789*1*72*66*0*12~

SVC*HC:80049*42*42~

SVC*HC:80054*30*30~

SVC*HC:82435*0*-6**0*HC:80054*1~

CAS*CO*18*1~

NOTE

When following Unbundling or Partial Unbundling procedures, payers are required to return all service lines related to a single submitted service line on the same claim. The claim splitting process specified in Section 1.10.2.11 - Claim Splitting can not be applied to the parts of an unbundled submitted service. When reporting bundling and unbundling it is required (if submitted on the 837) to maintain the use of the REF*6B Line Item Control Number. This allows the providers to track what happened to each original service line. See Section 1.10.2.11 - Claim Splitting for more information about line item controls.

1.10.2.7 Predetermination of Benefits
Tables 2 and 3 in the 835 also may contain information about future remittances that are to be paid when specified services are completed. The future payment is expressed as an adjustment in one of the CAS segments. Use a Claim Adjustment Group code of OA, "other adjustment," and a Claim Adjustment Reason Code of 101, "predetermination, anticipated payment upon completion of services." A predetermination must balance within a transaction set in the same way that claim payments must balance. Because the payment amount is actually zero now, adjustments must be adequate to reduce the claim balance to zero.

A predetermination is identified by Claim Status Code value 25, "predetermination pricing only -- no payment," in CLP02. Effectively, a predetermination is informational only and can be contained in an 835 that pays other claims.

Example

A provider submits a claim for predetermination of benefits to the PPO for a total claim charge amount of $1000.00. The payer determines that, if the claim is to be paid, the adjustments shown in Table 1.2 - Example Adjustments, are to be applied.

 Table 1.2 - Example Adjustments

Adjustment	Amount	Claim Adjustment Reason Code
Deductible	$50.00	Code 1
Coinsurance	$200.00	Code 2
Exceeded the fee schedule	$200.00	Code 45
The projected payment amount is then $550.

CAS*PR*1*50**2*200~

CAS*CO*45*200~

CAS*OA*101*550~

1.10.2.8 Reversals and Corrections
When the claim adjudication results have been modified from previous reporting, the method for revision is to reverse the entire claim and resend modified data. If any of the service lines within a claim were communicated as pended in the 835 when making a partial payment, the payer must reverse the original payment and resend the data when paying the pended lines. As an alternative to this method a payer may split the claim prior to making the partial payment. See Section 1.10.2.11 - Claim Splitting.

NOTE

Handling reversals internal to the 835 may cause system changes that need to be addressed as part of the implementation plan.

Example

In the original PPO payment, the reported charges were as follows in Table 1.3 - Reported Charges:

 Table 1.3 - Reported Charges

Submitted charges	$100.00
Adjustments

  Disallowed amount

  Coinsurance

 

$20.00

$16.00

Deductible	$24.00
Payment amount	$40.00
Original Payment

CLP*1234567890*1*100*40*40*12*CLAIM12345~

CAS*PR*1*24**2*16~

CAS*CO*45*20~

The payer found an error in the original claim adjudication that requires a correction. In this case, the disallowed amount should have been $40.00 instead of the original $20.00. The co-insurance amount should have been $12.00 instead of $16.00, and the deductible amount did remain the same.

Reversal Method

Reverse the original payment, restoring the patient accounting system to the pre-posting balance for this patient. Then, the payer sends the corrected claim payment to the provider for posting to the account.

It is anticipated that the provider has the ability to post these reversals electronically, without any human intervention.

Reversing the original claim payment is accomplished with code 22, "reversal of previous payment", Send original Claim Adjustment group codes in CAS01; and appropriate adjustments. All original charge, payment, and adjustment amounts are negated.

For the reversal, include any Supplemental Claim Information (AMT) segment iterations from the original claim payment that relate to interest or prompt payment discounts (qualifiers I and D8). Negate the dollar amount reported on the original claim adjudication. These reversed interest and prompt payment discount entries must be included in the net interest and prompt payment discount payments in the PLB segment. Do not report any other Claim Information (AMT) segments in the reversal claim. See Section 1.10.2.9 - Interest and Prompt Payment Discounts, for additional information.

CLP*1234567890*22*-100*-40**12*CLAIM12345~

CAS*PR*1*-24**2*-16~

CAS*CO*45*-20~

NOTE

The reversal does not contain any patient responsibility amount in CLP.

The corrected claim payment is provided as if it were the original payment. This must include any revised, non-zero, interest or prompt payment discount values in the Supplemental Claim Information (AMT) segment.

CLP*1234567890*1*100*24*36*12*CLAIM12345~

CAS*PR*1*24**2*12~

CAS*CO*45*40~

NOTES

Caution, while the claim paid amount (CLP04) for this claim can be zero or less, the reversal method included in Section 1.10.2.8 - Reversals and Corrections, must not cause the total payment for this 835 (BPR02) to become negative.

The example does not provide service line detail. If the service line detail had been on the original payment, then the reversal must apply the same reversal logic to the claim and service lines.

The CLP07 Payer Claim Control Number in the reversal must be identical to the CLP07 value in the original claim payment.

The CLP07 value for the correction claim may be a different value, but the authors recommend using the same value as in the original CLP07 if at all possible. When the CLP07 value for the corrected claim is different than the CLP07 value from the original claim, one iteration of the 2-040REF segment with REF01 equal to F8 (Original Reference number) and REF02 equal to the original CLP07 value is required in the correction claim.

1.10.2.9 Interest and Prompt Payment Discounts
Payer-provider level interest and prompt payment discounts refer to adjustments that specific payer and provider contractual agreements or regulations require. Convey the net for all claims in the remittance advice for interest in the Provider Adjustment Segment using Adjustment Reason code L6. Convey the net for all claims in the remittance advice for prompt payment discount in the Provider Adjustment Segment using Adjustment Reason code 90. Such adjustments are financially independent from the formula for determining benefit payments on behalf of the beneficiary receiving care. Consequently, providers must be able to post these types of adjustments to the general ledger rather than to the patient's account receivable. Additionally, providers must be able to examine the claim-specific information to validate the payer's adjudication calculation.

Convey claim-specific information in the Claim Supplemental Information Segment, AMT. Use code I, for "Interest," or use D8, "discount amount," for a prompt payment discount, in AMT01.

The nature of the financial adjustments conveyed in the PLB segment is identified in PLB03, Composite Adjustment Identifier. The payments can either increase -- reported as a negative number -- or decrease -- reported as a positive number -- the payment. The code values used for interest and prompt pay discounts within the PLB03 composite are as follows:

L6 - Interest Owed

Refers to interest adjustments made as part of the contractual agreement for handling claim obligations beyond the timelines established.

90 - Early Payment Discount

Refers to a prompt payment discount or the amount that is allowed for quickly paying a claim according to the terms of the contractual agreement.

In the case of a reversal and correction claim where interest or prompt payment discounts were part of the initial claim adjudication, the reversal claim must include the original interest or prompt payment amounts as negated values in the Claim Supplemental Information AMT segment. The corrected claim then includes the revised interest or prompt payment discount values, if appropriate. See Section 1.10.2.8 - Reversals and Corrections, for additional information.

NOTE

Managed care contracts also can show similar types of adjustments within the Provider Adjustment Segment. See Section 1.10.2.10 - Capitation and Related Payments or Adjustments, for the appropriate managed care references.

Summary

Use the PLB for net interest and net prompt pay discounts to reflect payer-provider agreements.

Supplemental Claim or Service Amounts in the AMT segments do not influence balancing the Claim or Service Payment loops or balancing the 835 for benefit payments made on behalf of the patient.

To reference Interest and prompt payment discounts use codes L6, "interest," and 90, "early payment discount,".

If any interest responsibility and/or prompt pay discounts are extended to the patient, report the data in the CAS segment, which impacts CLP04, Claim Payment Amount. Do not report the data in the AMT and PLB segments.

Example

Acme Insurance and Dr. Doe (Provider Number 12345) have an agreement whereby Acme pays Dr. Doe a 5% annual percentage rate (.0137% per day) of the claim payment for any claim that is not remitted or denied within 30 days, for each day over 20 days.

Melvin Jones (patient) has covered charges of $10,000, submitted electronically to Acme on November 10, 2001.

Acme processes the claim and determines that benefits payable are $9,000 with a patient deductible of $1,000.

Payment is remitted on January 24, 2002. The amount paid includes interest due for 55 days.

The interest amount is $67.81.

Interest information is provided in the Claim Supplemental Information Amounts Segment. The PLB is used to report provider level financial adjustment detail to be used within the balancing routine.

1.10.2.10 Capitation and Related Payments or Adjustments
The 835 is used to provide financial notification of capitation payments from a Managed Care Organization (MCO) to a capitated care provider. The 835 does not contain the capitation details or membership roster. Use an associated Eligibility and Benefits Notification Transaction Set (271) to communicate these details. Capitation payments may be included with claims payment information in a single 835 or they may be passed alone. In either case, the existing balancing process for the 835 applies.

Capitation payments and adjustments are reported in the PLB segment. Individual amounts are reported in PLB04, 06, 08, 10, 12, and 14.

NOTE

A POSITIVE amount reduces payment. A NEGATIVE amount increases payment.

PLB03, 05, 07, 09, 11, and 13 are used to provide the Adjustment Reason Code and the reference number associated with the payments and adjustments. In the case of a capitation payment related to a member list provided in a 271 transaction, the reference number from the Reassociation Key Segment identifying the 271 is provided as a PLB reference number for the appropriate dollar amount.

For identification and explanation purposes, use the following codes in Position 1 of the Composite Adjustment Identifier in the PLB segment.

AM - Applied to Borrowers Account

Loan Repayment is a repayment to the MCO of monies previously paid to the capitated provider for purchasing equipment. The repayment amount is deducted from the usual periodic payment that the provider would otherwise receive from the MCO.

BN - Bonus

Bonus Payment is an additional payment made to a primary care physician or other capitated provider at a set time agreed upon by both parties, usually to recognize performance above usual standards. The bonus payment may be based upon utilization parameters, quality measurements, membership services performed, or other factors.

CR - Capitation Interest

Interest payments represent a percentage payment in excess of the usual amount, paid to the capitated provider as a result of a late payment by the MCO or as a result of funds previously withheld.

CT - Capitation Payment

Capitation Payment is a set dollar amount paid to the primary care physician or other capitated provider selected by the member for the provision of services agreed upon by the provider and the MCO. The dollar amount may be based upon a member's age, sex, specific plan under which the member is enrolled, benefit limitations, or other predetermined factors. The payment is made at periodic set times generally defined in the contractual arrangement between the provider and the MCO.

E3 - Withholding

Withholding is a set dollar amount or percentage of the capitation payment deducted per the contractual agreement between the provider and the MCO. This amount may be returned to the provider at a later date, usually as a result of meeting specific performance requirements defined in the agreement.

FC - Fund Allocation

Fund Allocation is a methodology used to distribute payments made to the primary care or other capitated provider from funds designated for allocation. Funds may be prepaid amounts where deductions are withdrawn over a set period as services are provided.

IP - Incentive Premium Payments

Incentive Premium Payments are additional payments made to a capitated provider to acknowledge high quality services or to provide additional services that are not routinely considered as capitated services by the MCO. This payment also may be used as a financial incentive to sign new providers to the managed care network.

L3 - Penalty

A Penalty is a deduction made in the financial payment to the capitated provider as a result of non-fulfillment of a requirement stipulated in the contractual agreement between the provider and the MCO. Generally, the actual sum forfeited is defined in the agreement.

RA - Retro-Activity Adjustment

Retro-activity payments, adjustments, and notification are given to the capitated provider for an enrolled member who had selected or changed a capitation provider for a time period before the current payment period. This adjustment usually occurs because of late notification from an employer and/or member after the set cutoff time for a capitation payment/notification. This adjustment may result in a payment deduction to the provider in circumstances where the member disenrolled or was terminated from coverage under the MCO during a previous payment period.

TL - Third Party Liability

Third Party Liability indicates that another entity is liable for the payment of health care expenses. The capitation payment may be reduced for the reported time period as a result of the payment from the other responsible party.

For information about reporting encounters in the 835 see Section 1.10.2.19 - Reporting Encounters in the 835.

1.10.2.11 Claim Splitting
A claim submitted to a payer may, due to a payer's adjudication system requirement(s), have service line(s) separated from the original claim. The commonly used term for this process is 'splitting the claim'. Each portion of a claim that has been split has a separate claim control number, assigned by the payer and the sum of the service line(s) charge submitted on each split claim becomes the split claim total charge.

An example of this type of processing is a multi-line claim that contains a service line which requires further information to finalize. By splitting the pending service line to a separate claim, the payer can then adjudicate the remainder of the claim/service lines submitted. Once the split claim is finalized, the adjudication information for the split claim will be returned to the provider.

To assist the provider in reconciling their patient accounts, the payer must retain and return basic original claim information in each of the adjudicated claims. The original Claim Submitter's Identifier (CLM01) must be returned on all split claims in CLP01. The provider's original submitted line item control number from the claim must be returned in the REF segment, loop 2110. If the original claim did not contain a specific line item control number for the service lines, the line item sequence number (LX01) from the original claim must be used in the 835 REF segment instead.

In addition, payers must identify each claim as being part of a split claim by utilizing the MIA or MOA segment with Remittance Advice Remark Code MA15 (Your claim has been separated to expedite handling. You will receive a separate notice for the other services reported) on each of the adjudicated (split) claims. See the MIA and MOA segment detail for specific usage instructions.

1.10.2.12 Balance Forward Processing
A common practice within Health Care claim processing is the review and re-adjudication of claims. This practice sometimes results in additional payments to the provider. Other times it results in a reduction in the payment amount. While the reversal and correction process (see Section 1.10.2.8 - Reversals and Corrections) identifies the process for reporting these changes, one aspect has been left out. Since the 835 is a financial transaction and not just a report, the payment amount can not be negative. The question then arises, what do you do when refunds from reversals and corrections exceed the payments for new claims, resulting in a net negative payment? The answer is Balance Forward Processing.

The PLB segment's ability to report adjustments not related to a specific claim also allows for a balance forward adjustment. This capability allows a payer to move the negative balance from the current 835 transaction into a future transaction. The business objectives are:

Increase the net for the current 835 to $0.00.

Add the previous balance into a future 835 transaction.

Identify to the provider what has happened.

Identify a reference number for reconciliation of the balance forward process.

Moving a negative balance out of the current 835:

When a net negative payment is detected in an 835, this is corrected by adding a balance forwarding adjustment in the PLB segment. While any adjustment pair can be used in the PLB, PLB03 and PLB04 will be used for illustrative purposes. The adjustment reason used in PLB03-1 will be FB, "Forwarding Balance". The reference number in PLB03-2 will contain the same number as the trace number used in TRN02 of the current transaction. This reference number will facilitate tracking by the provider. The dollar amount in PLB04 will be the same as the current, negative, balance. Since the balancing section, Section 1.10.2.1.3 - Transaction Balancing, specifies that the transaction balance is the claim payment total minus the provider level adjustments, the transaction payment amount will now be $0.00. The value in BPR02 will be 0.

Assume that the current net for the transaction for provider "ABA8789" is $-200.00 and that the trace number in TRN02 is "1234554". To move the balance forward, the PLB segment will read:

PLB*ABA8789*20001231*FB:1234554*-200~

Since -200 minus -200 equals 0, the BPR segment will contain 0 in BPR02.

Adding the previously forwarded balance to a new 835:

When a balance forward adjustment was reported in a previous 835, a future 835 must add that money back in order to complete the process. In this case, the PLB segment is again used as the mechanism. PLB03-1 contains FB, "Forwarding Balance". PLB03-2 contains the same reference number from the PLB segment of the previous 835. This allows the receiver to quickly reconcile the two balance forward adjustments. PLB04 contains the same dollar amount as the previous day, but as a positive value. The positive number reduces the payment in this 835.

Continuing the same example, the PLB segment for the next remittance advice for the provider will be:

PLB*1234567894*20001231*FB:1234554*200~

NOTE

The sign of the dollar amount in the PLB segment determines whether the balance forward is moving from today into tomorrow or from yesterday into today.

Balance forward occurs only at the transaction level not at the claim level.

If the net for this new 835 is negative, the balance forward process would be repeated.

Since this is a new 835 with a new balance forward amount, the reference number in the appropriate Adjustment identifier composite (i.e. PLB03-2) will contain the same number as the trace number assigned in TRN02 of this new 835.

1.10.2.13 Secondary Payment Reporting Considerations
Many patients are covered by more than one health plan. In multi-payer situations, a hierarchy is established as to which plan is primary, secondary, or tertiary as applicable for payment of a patient's health care expenses. Secondary and tertiary payers are frequently referred to as "secondary" payers. All previous payer(s) are frequently referred to as the primary payer(s). Most secondary payers adjust their payments so that the total payments, primary and secondary, do not exceed the billed charges for covered services.

Each health plan defines when that plan is primary, secondary, or tertiary for a covered individual. Each payer's plan also generally defines its calculation methodology to determine its payment for services when another payer is primary. The calculation methodology often includes adjustments when the primary allows a higher or lower payment amount for a service than the secondary, if the primary's plan does not cover one or more services on a multi-service claim, if the amounts of deductible or coinsurance differ under the plans, or for other variables. To eliminate a possible disincentive for enrollment in more than one plan, some payers do not consider the full amount of the primary's payment when calculating their secondary payment.

From the perspective of the secondary payer, the "impact" of the primary payer's adjudication is a reduction in the payment amount. This "impact" may be up to the actual amount of the primary payment(s) plus contractual adjustment(s).

Report the "impact" in the appropriate claim or service level CAS segment with reason code 23 (Payment adjusted due to the impact of prior payer(s) adjudication including payments and/or adjustments.), and Claim Adjustment Group Code OA (Other Adjustment). Code OA is used to identify this as an administrative adjustment.

If a secondary payer allows more than the submitted amount the claim must still balance. This is reported as a CAS segment with a group code OA (Other Adjustments) and a reason code of 94 (Processed in Excess of Charges) with a negative dollar amount. From that point, apply all normal CAS adjustments to derive the reimbursement amount.

It is essential that any secondary payer report in the remittance advice only the primary amount that has actually impacted their secondary payment. In many cases, this "impact" is less than the actual primary payment. When this happens, reporting the "actual" payment would prevent the transaction from balancing.

The claim status code in CLP02 must report whether the claim is being processed as primary, secondary, or tertiary. An 835 transaction does not allow a secondary payer to report the "actual" amount of a primary's payment if different than the "impact" amount. Only a primary payer sends that information to a provider.

The AMT segment must be used to report the secondary payer's claim coverage amount or service allowed amount to the provider.

Report secondary claim payments using the following business process (the actual order in the 835 is not being specified):

Report the claim coverage amount or service allowed amount in the claim level AMT segment using qualifier AU (claim level) or B6 (service level) in AMT01.

Report any adjustments related to patient responsibility where the patient is still responsible for the adjusted amount after coordination of benefits with the previous payer(s). (Claim Adjustment Group Code equals PR).

Report any further reduction taken by the current payer as a result of the other payer(s) payment or contractual adjustment(s) (Claim Adjustment Group Code equals OA and Claim Adjustment Reason Code equals 23).

Report any additional contractual obligations, not previously reported by prior payer(s) that may remain after coordinating benefits with the other payer. (Claim Adjustment Group Code equals CO). For example, the secondary payer normally would have a contractual obligation of $200 on the submitted charge. The primary payer only had a contractual reduction of $100 which the secondary payer accounted for with CARC 23. The remaining balance on the expense after coordination is $50. In order to balance the transaction and report to the provider that additional funds need to be written-off, the secondary payer would report the $50 using group code CO and the appropriate CARC.

NOTE:

This includes any amounts that would normally have been the patient's responsibility, but are being satisfied by the current payer with amounts paid by the other payer(s).

See Section 3.3 - Business Scenario 3 for detailed examples.

1.10.2.14 Service Line Issues
While previous sections touched upon usage of the service line information, there is a basic philosophy in the 835 related to the service line that is critical to proper use of the 835.

Much of the information usage in the 835 depends upon the context of a particular service. Since the Claim Adjustment Reason Codes used in the CAS segment tend to be more generic than the codes traditionally used by payers, they depend on the context to create a complete message. Information in the SVC segment must frequently work with the Claim Adjustment Reason Codes to give the provider a message that will not result in calls to customer service.

The SVC segment provides two locations for service line procedure information. SVC01 always contains the coding for the procedure used in adjudication. SVC06 contains the original procedure code submitted by the provider when it is different than the coding in SVC01. Use of both of these locations is necessary to maximize administrative simplification benefits.

For instance, when reporting an adjustment for a post operative visit service that is being denied because the payment was included in the payment for the surgery, the CAS and SVC segments must work together to report the complete message. This situation is similar to procedure code bundling, except that one of the submitted services is the adjudicated procedure code. The CAS segment will report an adjustment code of 97 (Payment is included in the allowance for another service/procedure). But, this information is not adequate without reporting the surgery procedure code in SVC01 as well as the post operative procedure code in SVC06.

This ability to report an adjudicated and submitted procedure code must always be implemented to:

report changes in coding by the payer.

report adjudication decisions based upon a service reported on another line or claim rather that what was submitted by the provider for this line.

1.10.2.14.1 Service Line Splitting
During the adjudication process there may be times when a service line needs to be split. This section explains and shows examples of how service line splitting must be reported in the 835 ERA. This section also differentiates between Service Line Splitting and Unbundling of a service line.

Line splitting reported in the 835 may only be a result of a business issue. Line splitting as a result of an adjudication system limitation (Technical Issue), must be recombined prior to reporting in the 835. To help clarify this, examples of both types of issues are given below.

Business issues:

There may be times when a service line may need to be split by the payer for business reasons.

Examples when service line splitting is necessary include, but are not limited to:

The date of service range crosses a change in coverage

Some units process under one adjudicated procedure code and others process under a different adjudicated code

Some units process under one benefit rate and others process under a different benefit rate

Technical Issues (System Limitations):

Technical limitations are another reason for line splitting within the adjudication system. For example, the adjudication system only handles 2 place positions for units of service therefore 101 units submitted would be split into 99 units and 2 units respectively.

In some payer systems there are limitations on date ranges, forcing lines to be split to separate units by date.

This is not to say that the claims system can not split lines, but they must be recombined on the remittance.

Characteristics of Line Splitting vs Unbundling:

Line Splitting:

A submitted service line would be split into multiple lines.

Adjudicated Procedure code may or may not be the same as the submitted procedure code across split service lines in the SVC Segment.

The sum of the split line units must equal the total submitted units from the original service line.

Unbundling:

A submitted service line is reported as more than one SVC segment.

The adjudicated procedure code in the SVC segment will always be different than the submitted procedure code. Note: an exception to this is partial unbundling.

The sum of the unbundled units of service is greater than the total submitted units from the original service line.

NOTE

When both line splitting and unbundling are required, the payer must first apply the splitting logic, and then the unbundling logic.

Splitting Line Requirements:

When reporting split service lines in the 835 you must:

Retain the original submitted procedure code

Sum of split lines' units of service must equal the original submitted units of service with each split line.

Allocate the submitted charge proportionately by units of service across the split lines. The sum of the split lines' submitted charges must equal the original submitted line charge.

Return the line item control number from the original line on all split lines. If no line item control number was received, use the original line item sequence as the line item control number.

Report one LQ segment iteration with LQ01 equal to HE and LQ02 equal to N123 (This is a split service and represents a portion of the units from the originally submitted service.)

Example 1

A Provider submitted a claim with one service line for 4 units for a new patient visit. In this situation, the payer decides to split the line into 2 separate lines, one line for the new patient visit and one line for the 3 remaining visits that were down-coded to an established patient visit.

Line Splitting Across Claims:

An example of Service line splitting: A claim with 5 revenue lines, the lines are split on to two claims, where two of the lines will remain on the original claim, two will be moved to the new claim and the last line will be split between the two claims based on periods of service. Thus, there is no procedure code change and the units remain the same, just split between two claims.

It is possible to have an original claim with split lines that are also split to separate claims. For example, a business reason for splitting a claim is when service line dates of service cross the dates of service of a benefit plan. Another example for splitting the claim is when some lines are going to be pended for further review and other lines are ready to be paid. Additionally these two situations can result in split lines across split claims.

Criteria for split claims and split lines must be maintained in this situation. These are:

Claim Submitter's Identification (CLM01) must be returned on all split claims in CLP01.

The amount on each claim becomes the split claim total charge.

The original submitted line item control number or (when not present) the line item sequence number from the claim must be returned in the service identification REF segment 2110.

Remark codes at the service level and claim level are required in this situation.

1.10.2.15 PPOs, Networks and Contract Types
Many payers may encounter a situation where a particular provider has contracted with several different Preferred Provider Organizations, contract types or networks (PPOs) offered by that payer. This transaction set provides a method for communicating to a provider which contract applies to a particular claim.

NOTE

Contract Types includes but is not limited to products and lines of business of the health plan. The specific need for identification is determined by the business alignment of the health plan and how that determines payment to providers rather than any objective concept of network or product line.

When adjusting the claim for the PPO discount, the amount of the adjustment is reported in the CAS segment contained in loop 2100 or 2110, whichever is applicable. The adjustment amount is reported in the CAS segment using group code CO, contractual obligation in CAS01, an appropriate adjustment reason code and amount. The name or identifier of the PPO is reported in REF02 of the Other Claim Related Information REF segment using code CE in REF01. While it is possible that free-form text may be transmitted in the REF segment, it is recommended that each payer develop a standardized list of PPOs (or other payment arrangements), to facilitate automated processing by providers.

For example, assume that Provider P has contracted with two PPOs, A and B. Assume further that the claim was submitted as $75.00 and has been repriced by PPO B to $55.00. The pertinent parts of the claim would then appear as follows:

CAS*CO*45*20~

REF*CE*B~

1.10.2.16 Post Payment Recovery
The 835 is used for the payment of claims to other payers in a post payment recovery situation when there is a clear and legally established subrogation of third party liability. Such a situation includes, but is not limited to, Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Program) as contained in Section 1902(a)(25). For a post payment recovery claim the 835 can be used to: make a payment; send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) remittance advice; or make a payment and send an EOB remittance advice from one health care payer to another health care payer, either directly or through a DFI.

1.10.2.17 Claim Overpayment Recovery
While all health plans strive for accurate adjudication on the first pass, occasionally adjudication mistakes are detected (sometimes through an appeal process) that result in changes to either the amount paid or the allocation of further responsibility for unpaid balances. When the payment increases or the responsibility (contractual obligation versus patient responsibility) changes without a change in payment the reversal and correction process described in Section 1.10.2.8 - Reversals and Corrections describes the necessary actions within the 835. However, when the review results in a reduction of the claim payment amount, the business gets more complicated in how to accomplish an overpayment recovery. Basically, there are three business approaches to claim overpayment recovery. The health plan should specify its methodology for claim overpayment recovery in either a trading partner agreement or a provider contract.

A health plan may choose to recoup the overpayment immediately within the current remittance advice (835). When this is the business model, the reversal and corrections instructions in Section 1.10.2.8 - Reversals and Corrections describe the necessary actions.

A health plan may choose to not recoup the funds immediately and use a manual reporting process to the provider. This process involves sending a letter identifying the claim, the changes to the adjudication, the balance due to the health plan and a statement identifying how long (or if) the provider has to remit that balance. This document must contain a financial control number (FCN) for tracking purposes. Upon receipt of the letter, the provider will manually update the accounts receivable system to record the changes to the claim payment.

If the provider chooses to remit the balance due within the specified time period with a check, the health plan will acknowledge the receipt of the check using the PLB segment of the next 835. In order to maintain a balanced 835, this is accomplished using offsetting adjustments in the PLB. PLB03-1 codes 72 (Authorized Return) and WO (Overpayment Recovery) are used.

Example: A health plan sends a letter to a provider (number 1234) identifying an overpayment of $37.50. The FCN of the document is 56473. Before the specified deadline, the provider remits the overpayment to the health plan, identifying the FCN with the payment. A PLB segment in the next 835 would report this payment.

PLB*1234*20011231*WO:56473*37.5*72:56473*-37.5~

If the provider chooses (or is instructed) to not remit the overpayment by the established deadline, then the health plan will recoup the funds in an appropriate 835. This is accomplished using the PLB segment, and NOT the reversal and correction procedure. Reversal and correction is not appropriate since the provider's system has already been updated manually to reflect the adjudication changes. PLB code WO (Overpayment Recovery) is used to effect the recovery.

This process would also be used if the provider were to remit the funds without the payer initiating the refund.

The payer would acknowledge that the funds were received using the original trace number to indicate which payment the overpayment was from. WO would be used for this situation as well.

Example: A health plan sends a letter to a provider (number 1234) identifying an overpayment of $37.50. The FCN of the document is 56473. The provider does not remit the overpayment to the health plan. A PLB segment in the next 835 would report the overpayment recovery.

PLB*1234*20011231*WO:56473*37.5~

The health plan may use a combination of methods 1 and 2 for overpayment recovery. The reversal and correction process (Section 1.10.2.8 - Reversals and Corrections) would provide the claim specific information. Within the same 835, a PLB segment is then used to return the funds to the provider and NOT reduce the current payment. This is effectively delaying the recovery of funds within the 835. The FCN reported would be the health plan's internal control number for the claim involved in the recovery (CLP07). The external agreement identifying how the health plan is doing overpayment recovery would specify the time period within which the provider may send the payment or that the provider may not send the payment. PLB03-1 code WO (Overpayment Recovery) is used with a negative dollar amount to eliminate the financial impact of the reversal and correction from the current 835. When the payment is received from the provider, or the health plan recoups the funds, the process identified in option 2 is followed to report the payment or recoup the funds, as appropriate.

Example: The health plan re-adjudicates a claim (number 837483) resulting in an overpayment recovery of $37.50 from provider number 1234. The reversal and correction are reported in the 835 (not shown) with a PLB segment to reverse the current financial impact.

PLB*1234*20011231*WO:837483*-37.5~

The provider remits the balance before the deadline identified in the agreement with the health plan. The next 835 reconciles the payment with the previous receivable using the PLB segment.

PLB*1234*20011231*WO:837483*37.5*72:837483*-37.5~

NOTE

If any of the above processes result in an 835 with a negative balance (BPR02), the balance forwarding process identified in Section 1.10.2.12 - Balance Forward Processing is used to eliminate the negative value in BPR02.

1.10.2.18 Totals within the 835
The 835 does not provide extensive totaling of claim payment information. While many older proprietary formats provided this information, the generation of totals is mostly left to the receiver of the transaction, if they desire the information. Since the 835 is expected to be an electronically processed transaction, the totals are seen as an output from that process, rather than as a direct part of the 835.

The total that is always included in the 835 is the total paid amount in the BPR02. In instances where the business situation requires use of the TS3 segment, the TS3 segment will provide total number of claims for a 2000 loop in TS304 and the total claim charge in TS305.

Some of the other totals that can be calculated are described below. This is not an all inclusive list. Other desired totals can be calculated in similar ways.

Total Number of Claims - count of the number of CLP segments in the 835.

Total Claim Charge - sum of the CLP03 values in the 835.

Total Covered Charge - sum of all AMT02 values where AMT01 equals "AU". See the note in the Claim Supplemental Information AMT01, code "AU" for additional information.

Total Non-Covered Charge - sum of the CAS03, 6, 9, 12, 15 & 18 values in the appropriate 2000 loop where CAS02, 5, 8, 11, 14 or 17 equals values desired by the provider as defining "non-covered charges". The term non-covered charges includes various portions of the rejected claim charge, depending upon interpretation. For example, specific Claim Adjustment Reason codes that can be included here are 47, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 60, 78, 96, 111, 117, B1, B8, B9, B11, B14, and 119. Please see the code list for the various definitions. The general code for non-covered charges is 96.

Total Claim Provider Payment - sum of the CLP04 values in the appropriate 2000 loop.

Total Provider Patient Responsibility Amount - sum of the CLP05 values in the appropriate 2000 loop.

Total Interest - PLB04, 6, 8, 10, 12 & 14 when the related adjustment Reason code is "L6".

Total Provider Contractual Obligation Adjustment - sum of the CAS03, 6, 9, 12, 15 & 18 values in the appropriate 2000 loop where CAS01 equals "CO". The desired amount may be refined by providers based upon specific Adjustment Reason Code information, if appropriate.

Total Coinsurance Amount -- sum of the CAS03, 6, 9, 12, 15 & 18 values in the appropriate 2000 loop where CAS02, 5, 8, 11, 14 or 17 equals value "2".

Total Deductible Amount - sum of the CAS03, 6, 9, 12, 15 & 18 values in the appropriate 2000 loop where CAS02, 5, 8, 11, 14 or 17 equals value "1".

1.10.2.19 Reporting Encounters in the 835
Encounters (services covered under a capitation agreement between the payer and the provider) present special challenges in the 835. Whether a specific encounter is really an encounter is a complicated issue. To be an encounter for 835 purposes, both the payer and provider must agree that the claim and/or service is an encounter. The payer identifies this through adjudication. Submitters may indicate 837 transaction contains all encounters by providing the value 'RP' BHT06. When BHT06 equals 'CH', the transaction may or may not include some encounters in addition to chargeable claims.

This leads to 3 scenarios.

A pure encounter claim - Pure encounter claims do not need to be reported in the 835. If the claim was submitted as all encounters and the payer agrees that it was all encounters then no response is sent in the 835. Conversely, if a claim was submitted as all encounters, through use of the BHT segment, and the payer does not agree that it was all encounters, then a response must be sent in the 835.

A mixed claim - If a claim was submitted with some encounter services and some payable services, the payer is obligated to return all received services that were submitted with a charge greater than $0.00 and any $0.00 services that were identified as payable during adjudication.

The payer is able to report payment of $0.00 services by using Claim Adjustment Reason Code 94 (Processed in excess of charges) and a negative dollar amount representing the payer's allowed amount for that service.

Additional adjustments to identify patient responsibility for deductible, copay or other adjustments would also be provided. Any services reported with a $0.00 charge and identified as capitated services by the payer do not need to be returned in the 835.

All payable claim - If a claim is submitted with all charges >$0.00 (and was not part of a submission identified as all encounters using BHT), the payer is obligated to return all services. Services that the payer determines are covered under the capitation agreement must be adjusted to $0.00 payment using Claim Adjustment Reason Code 24 (Payment for charges adjusted. Charges covered under a capitation agreement/managed care plan).

NOTE

This section does not change the ability to report inpatient claims without service detail when payment is made at the claim level as described in Section 1.10.2.4 - Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segment Theory (Institutional-Specific Use).

2.2 Implementation Usage
2.2.1 Industry Usage
Industry Usage describes when loops, segments, and elements are to be sent when complying with this implementation guide. The three choices for Usage are required, not used, and situational. To avoid confusion, these are named differently than the X12 standard Condition Designators (mandatory, optional, and relational).

Required  

This loop/segment/element must always be sent.

Required segments in Situational loops only occur when the loop is used.

Required elements in Situational segments only occur when the segment is used.

Required component elements in Situational composite elements only occur when the composite element is used.

Not Used  

This element must never be sent.

Situational  

Use of this loop/segment/element varies, depending on data content and business context as described in the defining rule. The defining rule is documented in a Situational Rule attached to the item.

There are two forms of Situational Rules.

The first form is "Required when <explicit condition statement>. If not required by this implementation guide, may be provided at the sender's discretion, but cannot be required by the receiver." The data qualified by such a situational rule cannot be required or requested by the receiver, transmission of this data is solely at the sender's discretion.

The alternative form is "Required when <explicit condition statement>. If not required by this implementation guide, do not send." The data qualified by such a situational rule cannot be sent except as described in the explicit condition statement.

Required when there is a business contact area that would apply to this remittance and all the claims. If not required by this implementation guide, do not send.

TR3 Notes:	
1.	When the communication number represents a telephone number in the United States and other countries using the North American Dialing Plan (for voice, data, fax, etc.), the communication number always includes the area code and phone number using the format AAABBBCCCC. Where AAA is the area code, BBB is the telephone number prefix, and CCCC is the telephone number (e.g. (800) 555-1212 would be represented as 8005551212). The extension number, when applicable, is identified in the next element pair (Communications Number Qualifier and Communication Number) immediately after the telephone number.

Claim Filing Indicator Code
O 1	ID	1/2
	
Code identifying type of claim

	
For many providers to electronically post the 835 remittance data to their patient accounting systems without human intervention, a unique, provider-specific insurance plan code is needed. This code allows the provider to separately identify and manage the different product lines or contractual arrangements between the payer and the provider. Because most payers maintain the same Originating Company Identifier in the TRN03 or BPR10 for all product lines or contractual relationships, the CLP06 is used by the provider as a table pointer in combination with the TRN03 or BPR10 to identify the unique, provider-specific insurance plan code needed to post the payment without human intervention. The value should mirror the value received in the original claim (2-005 SBR09 of the 837), if applicable, or provide the value as assigned or edited by the payer. For example the BL from the SBR09 in the 837 would be returned as 12, 13, 15, in the 835 when more details are known. The 837 SBR09 code CI (Commercial Insurance) is generic, if through adjudication the specific type of plan is obtained a more specific code must be returned in the 835.

	
The 837 and 835 transaction code lists for this element are not identical by design. There are some business differences between the two transactions. When a code from the 837 is not available in the 835 another valid code from the 835 must be assigned by the payer.

Required when dollar amounts and/or quantities are being adjusted at the claim level. If not required by this implementation guide, do not send.

TR3 Notes:	
1.	Payers must use this CAS segment to report claim level adjustments that cause the amount paid to differ from the amount originally charged. See 1.10.2.1, Balancing, and 1.10.2.4, Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segment Theory, for additional information.

2.	See the SVC TR3 Note #1 for details about per diem adjustments.

3.	A single CAS segment contains six repetitions of the "adjustment trio" composed of adjustment reason code, adjustment amount, and adjustment quantity. These six adjustment trios are used to report up to six adjustments related to a specific Claim Adjustment Group Code (CAS01). The six iterations (trios) of the Adjustment Reason Code related to the Specific Adjustment Group Code must be exhausted before repeating a second iteration of the CAS segment using the same Adjustment Group Code. The first adjustment must be the first non-zero adjustment and is reported in the first adjustment trio (CAS02-CAS04). If there is a second non-zero adjustment, it is reported in the second adjustment trio (CAS05-CAS07), and so on through the sixth adjustment trio (CAS17-CAS19).

Claim Adjustment Group Code
M 1	ID	1/2
	
Code identifying the general category of payment adjustment

	
Evaluate the usage of group codes in CAS01 based on the following order for their applicability to a set of one or more adjustments: PR, CO, PI, OA. See 1.10.2.4, Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segment Theory, for additional information. (Note: This does not mean that the adjustments must be reported in this order.)

	
CODE      	DEFINITION


CO	Contractual Obligations
 	
Use this code when a joint payer/payee contractual agreement or a regulatory requirement resulted in an adjustment.

OA	Other adjustments
 	
Avoid using the Other Adjustment Group Code (OA) except for business situations described in sections 1.10.2.6, 1.10.2.7 and 1.10.2.13.

PI	Payor Initiated Reductions
 	
Use this code when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments).

PR	Patient Responsibility

When the communication number represents a telephone number in the United States and other countries using the North American Dialing Plan (for voice, data, fax, etc.), the communication number always includes the area code and phone number using the format AAABBBCCCC. Where AAA is the area code, BBB is the telephone number prefix, and CCCC is the telephone number (e.g. (800)555-1212 would be represented as 8005551212). The extension number, when applicable, is identified in the next element pair (Communications Number Qualifier and Communication Number) immediately after the telephone number.

2.	If used for inpatient claims and no service date was provided on the claim then report the through date from the claim level.

3.	When claim dates are not provided, service dates are required for every service line.

4.	When claim dates are provided, service dates are not required, but if used they override the claim dates for individual service lines.

5.	For retail pharmacy claims, the service date is equivalent to the prescription filled date.

6.	For predeterminations, where there is no service date, the value of DTM02 must be 19000101. Use only when the CLP02 value is 25 - Predetermination Pricing Only - No Payment.

7.	When payment is being made in advance of services, the use of future dates is allowed.

1.	Adjustment information is intended to help the provider balance the remittance information. Adjustment amounts should fully explain the difference between submitted charges and the amount paid.

Loop:	
2110 — SERVICE PAYMENT INFORMATION
Segment Repeat:	
99
Usage:	
SITUATIONAL

Situational Rule:	
Required when dollar amounts are being adjusted specific to the service or when the paid amount for a service line (SVC03) is different than the original submitted charge amount for the service (SVC02). If not required by this implementation guide, do not send.

TR3 Notes:	
1.	An example of this level of CAS is the reduction for the part of the service charge that exceeds the usual and customary charge for the service. See sections 1.10.2.1, Balancing, and 1.10.2.4, Claim Adjustment and Service Adjustment Segment Theory, for additional information.

2.	A single CAS segment contains six repetitions of the "adjustment trio" composed of adjustment reason code, adjustment amount, and adjustment quantity. These six adjustment trios are used to report up to six adjustments related to a specific Claim Adjustment Group Code (CAS01). The six iterations (trios) of the Adjustment Reason Code related to the Specific Adjustment Group Code must be exhausted before repeating a second iteration of the CAS segment using the same Adjustment Group Code. The first adjustment is reported in the first adjustment trio (CAS02-CAS04). If there is a second non-zero adjustment, it is reported in the second adjustment trio (CAS05-CAS07), and so on through the sixth adjustment trio (CAS17-CAS19).

This is the Late Claim Filing Penalty or Medicare Late Cost Report Penalty.

51	Interest Penalty Charge
 	
This is the interest assessment for late filing.

72	Authorized Return
 	
This is the provider refund adjustment. This adjustment acknowledges a refund received from a provider for previous overpayment. PLB03-2 must always contain an identifying reference number when the value is used. PLB04 must contain a negative value. This adjustment must always be offset by some other PLB adjustment referring to the original refund request or reason. For balancing purposes, the amount related to this adjustment reason code must be directly offset.

90	Early Payment Allowance

AH	Origination Fee
 	
This is the claim transmission fee. This is used for transmission fees that are not specific to or dependent upon individual claims.

AM	Applied to Borrower's Account

AP	Acceleration of Benefits
 	
This is the accelerated payment amount or withholding. Withholding or payment identification is indicated by the sign of the amount in PLB04. A positive value represents a withholding. A negative value represents a payment.

B2	Rebate
 	
This adjustment code applies when a provider has remitted an overpayment to a health plan in excess of the amount requested by the health plan. The amount accepted by the health plan is reported using code 72 (Authorized Return) and offset by the amount with code WO (Overpayment Recovery). The excess returned by the provider is reported as a negative amount using code B2, returning the excess funds to the provider.

B3	Recovery Allowance
 	
This represents the check received from the provider for overpayments generated by payments from other payers. This code differs from the provider refund adjustment identified with code 72. This adjustment must always be offset by some other PLB adjustment referring to the original refund request or reason. For balancing purposes, the amount related to this adjustment reason code must be directly offset.

BD	Bad Debt Adjustment
 	
This is the bad debt passthrough.

BN	Bonus
 	
This is capitation specific. See 1.10.2.10, Capitation and Related Payments or Adjustments, for additional information.

FB	Forwarding Balance
 	
This is the balance forward. A negative value in PLB04 represents a balance moving forward to a future payment advice. A positive value represents a balance being applied from a previous payment advice. A reference number must be supplied in PLB03-2 for tracking purposes. See 1.10.2.12, Balance Forward Processing, for further information.

FC	Fund Allocation
 	
This is capitation specific. See 1.10.2.10, Capitation and Related Payments or Adjustments, for additional information. The specific fund must be identified in PLB03-2.

GO	Graduate Medical Education Passthru

HM	Hemophilia Clotting Factor Supplement

IP	Incentive Premium Payment
 	
This is capitation specific. See 1.10.2.10, Capitation and Related Payments or Adjustments, for additional information.

IR	Internal Revenue Service Withholding

IS	Interim Settlement
 	
This is the interim rate lump sum adjustment.

J1	Nonreimbursable
 	
This offsets the claim or service level data that reflects what could be paid if not for demonstration program or other limitation that prevents issuance of payment.

L3	Penalty
 	
This is the capitation-related penalty. Withholding or release is identified by the sign in PLB04. See 1.10.2.10, Capitation and Related Payments or Adjustments, for additional information.

L6	Interest Owed
 	
This is the interest paid on claims in this 835. Support the amounts related to this adjustment by 2-062 AMT amounts, where AMT01 is "I".

LE	Levy
 	
IRS Levy

LS	Lump Sum
 	
This is the disproportionate share adjustment, indirect medical education passthrough, non-physician passthrough, passthrough lump sum adjustment, or other passthrough amount. The specific type of lump sum adjustment must be identified in PLB03-2.

OA	Organ Acquisition Passthru

OB	Offset for Affiliated Providers
 	
Identification of the affiliated providers must be made on PLB03-2.

PI	Periodic Interim Payment
 	
This is the periodic interim lump sum payments and reductions (PIP). The payments are made to a provider at the beginning of some period in advance of claims. These payments are advances on the expected claims for the period. The reductions are the recovery of actual claims payments during the period. For instance, when a provider has a PIP payment, claims within this remittance advice covered by that payment would be offset using this code to remove the claim payment from the current check. The sign of the amount in PLB04 determines whether this is a payment (negative) or reduction (positive).

This payment and recoupment is effectively a loan to the provider and loan repayment.

See section 1.10.2.5, Advance Payments and Reconciliation, for additional information.

PL	Payment Final
 	
This is the final settlement.

RA	Retro-activity Adjustment
 	
This is capitation specific. See 1.10.2.10, Capitation and Related Payments or Adjustments, for additional information.

Chapter 3. Examples
3.1 Business Scenario 1
Dollars and data are being sent together through the banking system to pay Medicare Part A institutional claims.

This scenario depicts the use of the ANSI ASC X12 835 in a governmental institutional environment. The electronic transmission of funds request and the remittance detail are contained within this single 835. In this scenario, one or more Depository Financial Institutions is involved in transferring information from the sender to the receiver.

3.1.1 Assumptions
The following assumptions pertain to scenario one:

The dollars move using the ACH network from the Bank of Payorea, ABA# 999999992, account number 123456 to the Bank of No Return, ABA# 999988880, checking account number 98765. The money moves on September 13, 2002.

The Insurance Company of Timbucktu, Federal tax ID # 512345678 and Medicare Intermediary ID# 999, is paying Regional Hope Hospital, National Provider Number 6543210903. This is for one inpatient and one outpatient claim.

3.3 Business Scenario 3
Regardless of which COB methodology is used to derive a subsequent payment, the following examples provide illustrations of how to report secondary or tertiary payments back to the provider that will facilitate auto-posting.

Considerations used in each example:

What was the primary payer's payment?

What is the amount, after COB that the patient is responsible to pay for the service?

What was the impact of the primary payer's handling of the claim (payment and contractual adjustments) upon the current payer's benefit determination?

What amount, if any, does the provider still need to write-off (contractual obligations)?

3.3.1 Assumptions
In the first claim, YTDAW (Your Tax Dollars at Work) payer receives the claim as secondary with a submitted charge of $10323.64. The primary payer (Old World Insurance, a Medicare carrier) allowed $8441.31 of the total submitted charges. A deductible of $912.00 and a contractual adjustment of $1882.33 were applied. The primary payer paid $7529.31 of the submitted charges.

YTDAW, as the secondary payer, is only required to pay the deductible based on the coverage of this contract. After the $912.00 payment is made, the patient, William Peter Townsend does not have a balance due for this provider.

In the second claim, YTDAW payer received a claim as secondary for Angi Baki with a submitted charge of $751.50 for two services rendered. The primary payer (Patients United Health) allowed for one service but denied the other as a noncovered procedure. The amount charged for the covered procedure was $166.50 and $150.00 was allowed. The primary payer paid $120.00 with $30.00 coinsurance due and a contractual adjustment of $16.50. The charge for the non-covered service was $585.00; therefore, the total patient responsibility was $615.00.

YTDAW as the secondary payer allowed $650.00 for the total submitted charges. The secondary payer allowed $150.00 for one service and $500.00 for the other service. The patient owed a deductible of $150.00 and YTDAW paid $310.00 for this claim. The impact of the primary payer's payment upon the secondary payment is $136.50 (the $16.50 contractual adjustment plus their $120.00 payment). After reviewing all of the adjustments, the provider still has an $85.00 contractual adjustment based on YTDAW's fee schedule with this provider.

3.3.2 Assumptions
This is an example of a tertiary payment. The patient, Ellis E. Island, has three insurance companies. The total charge for his claim is $1766.50. The primary payer allowed $1600.00 and applied a contractual adjustment of $166.50 as part of the provider's fee schedule. The allowed amount was paid at 80% after a $500.00 deductible was applied. The primary payer paid $880.00.

The secondary payer also allowed $1600.00 for the total submitted charge of $1766.50. The secondary payer calculated their payment as primary to determine the difference in paying primary versus secondary. After evaluating the primary payment of $880.00, the secondary payer paid $310.00. The impact of the primary payer's payment upon the secondary payment is $1046.50 (their contractual adjustment of $166.50 plus their $880.00 payment).

YTDAW as the tertiary payer allowed $1700.00 of the submitted $1766.50 charge. The tertiary payer also calculated their payment as primary and determined that the total amount that could be paid was $1377.50. After evaluating the primary and secondary payments and adjustments, YTDAW paid $187.50. The impact of the primary and secondary payer's payments upon the tertiary payment is $1356.580 (primary amount of $1046.50 and secondary amount of $310.00). Therefore, total remaining patient balance for the provider is $222.50.

In this claim, the primary payer received a claim for $541.00. They allowed $400 and paid $375.00 of the submitted charges. The primary payer applied $141.00 as a contractual adjustment that was part of the provider's fee schedule. The patient, Raymond Burck owed a co-pay of $25.00.

YTDAW as the secondary payer allowed $550.00 for the service submitted. This amount is $9.00 more than charged. The secondary payer paid $34.00. The impact of the primary payer's payment on the secondary payer is $516.00 ($141.00 contractual adjustment and $375.00 payment).

3.3.1 Assumptions
In the first claim, YTDAW (Your Tax Dollars at Work) payer receives the claim as secondary with a submitted charge of $10323.64. The primary payer (Old World Insurance, a Medicare carrier) allowed $8441.31 of the total submitted charges. A deductible of $912.00 and a contractual adjustment of $1882.33 were applied. The primary payer paid $7529.31 of the submitted charges.

YTDAW, as the secondary payer, is only required to pay the deductible based on the coverage of this contract. After the $912.00 payment is made, the patient, William Peter Townsend does not have a balance due for this provider.

In the second claim, YTDAW payer received a claim as secondary for Angi Baki with a submitted charge of $751.50 for two services rendered. The primary payer (Patients United Health) allowed for one service but denied the other as a noncovered procedure. The amount charged for the covered procedure was $166.50 and $150.00 was allowed. The primary payer paid $120.00 with $30.00 coinsurance due and a contractual adjustment of $16.50. The charge for the non-covered service was $585.00; therefore, the total patient responsibility was $615.00.

YTDAW as the secondary payer allowed $650.00 for the total submitted charges. The secondary payer allowed $150.00 for one service and $500.00 for the other service. The patient owed a deductible of $150.00 and YTDAW paid $310.00 for this claim. The impact of the primary payer's payment upon the secondary payment is $136.50 (the $16.50 contractual adjustment plus their $120.00 payment). After reviewing all of the adjustments, the provider still has an $85.00 contractual adjustment based on YTDAW's fee schedule with this provider.

3.3.2 Assumptions
This is an example of a tertiary payment. The patient, Ellis E. Island, has three insurance companies. The total charge for his claim is $1766.50. The primary payer allowed $1600.00 and applied a contractual adjustment of $166.50 as part of the provider's fee schedule. The allowed amount was paid at 80% after a $500.00 deductible was applied. The primary payer paid $880.00.

The secondary payer also allowed $1600.00 for the total submitted charge of $1766.50. The secondary payer calculated their payment as primary to determine the difference in paying primary versus secondary. After evaluating the primary payment of $880.00, the secondary payer paid $310.00. The impact of the primary payer's payment upon the secondary payment is $1046.50 (their contractual adjustment of $166.50 plus their $880.00 payment).

YTDAW as the tertiary payer allowed $1700.00 of the submitted $1766.50 charge. The tertiary payer also calculated their payment as primary and determined that the total amount that could be paid was $1377.50. After evaluating the primary and secondary payments and adjustments, YTDAW paid $187.50. The impact of the primary and secondary payer's payments upon the tertiary payment is $1356.580 (primary amount of $1046.50 and secondary amount of $310.00). Therefore, total remaining patient balance for the provider is $222.50.

3.3.3 Assumptions
In this claim, the primary payer received a claim for $541.00. They allowed $400 and paid $375.00 of the submitted charges. The primary payer applied $141.00 as a contractual adjustment that was part of the provider's fee schedule. The patient, Raymond Burck owed a co-pay of $25.00.

YTDAW as the secondary payer allowed $550.00 for the service submitted. This amount is $9.00 more than charged. The secondary payer paid $34.00. The impact of the primary payer's payment on the secondary payer is $516.00 ($141.00 contractual adjustment and $375.00 payment).
